# Real-time reconstruction of physical environments for digital worlds 
## This project is a capstone (final degree project) and an academic Internship with NTT and Insper

This project aims to allow two people from different locations to see and experience one of their real physical location, allowing them to see each other in one of their places, but virtually. Furthermore, to develop such a project, it was used the Digital Twin representation where a physical world would be represented in a virtual format elsewhere. To do that, one user would be using an augmented reality glass, where he/she would see a representation of his colleague avatar. The other user would be wearing a virtual reality headset, where he would experience the augmented realities ambient. Moreover, to accomplish this task, a prototype was developed, where one would use a Magic Leap 1 headset, scanning his space so that a second party can walk in this ambient with an HTC Vive Virtual Reality equipment.
